# untidydata

An R package of untidy datasets made for the purpose of teaching the
tidyverse.

Last update: 2018-09-22

## Overview

The purpose of this package is to store untidy datasets I have been
creating for teaching purposes in a version controlled environment. The
datasets vary in difficulty and present different problems common when
tidying data.

## Datasets

  - [language\_diversity](#language_diversity)
  - [pre\_post](#pre_post)
  - [spanish\_vowels](#spanish_vowels)
  - [spirantization](#spirantization)
  - [vot](#vot)

### `language_diversity`

  - Difficulty: easy
  - A long format dataset that is most useful in wide format.
  - Data taken from Appendix 1 in:  
    Nettle, D. (1998). Explaining Global Patterns of Language Diversity.
    *Journal of Anthropological Archaeology*, 17, 354â€“374.

### `pre_post`

  - Difficulty: easy
  - A typical pre-test, post-test data set in wide format.

### `spanish_vowels`

  - Difficulty: easy
  - Simulated Spanish vowel formant measurements from male and female
    speakers.

### `spirantization`

  - Difficulty: easy
  - Simulated intensity measurements of CV sequences in word initial and
    word medial position from L2 learners and native speakers.

### `vot`

  - Difficulty: medium
  - A voice-onset time data set. Includes coronal stop data from English
    and Spanish monolinguals, as well as English/Spanish bilinguals.
